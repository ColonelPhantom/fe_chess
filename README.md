# fe_chess
A currently 0x88 mailbox-based chess engine in Rust

## Installation
fe_chess installs like a normal cargo crate: clone the repo and `cargo build --release`.
The executable will be in `target/release`.

It can also be ran with `cargo run --release` or the binaries on the Releases page.

## Usage
fe_chess currently only has a simple built-in shell that is not compatible with uci. Type `help` to get a list of command. (UCI not functional).
